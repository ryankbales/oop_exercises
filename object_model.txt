1. To create an object in ruby, we use the keyword Class.

      Class BirdDog
      end

      cinder = BirdDog.new

2.  By using the keyword include we can mixin what is called Modules, a collection of methods and/or behaviors
    that can be used in a Class.

      module Command
        def command(command)
          puts #{command}
        end
      end

      Class BirdDog
        include Command
      end

      cinder = BirdDog.new
      cinder.command("Sit")
